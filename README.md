## Introduction
Aarlo is an Asynchronous Arlo component for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), it uses the [Arlo Website](https://my.arlo.com/#/cameras) APIs and supports base stations, cameras, lights and doorbells.

Aarlo is based on the original [Arlo component](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/arlo/) and it can operate as replacement with minimal configuration changes.

Aarlo also provides a custom [Lovelace Card](https://github.com/twrecked/lovelace-hass-aarlo), which overlays a camera's last snapshot with its current status and allows access to the cameras recording library and live streaming.

<a name="introduction-features"></a>
#### Features

Aarlo provides:
- Access to cameras, base stations, sirens, doorbells and lights.
- Asynchronous, almost immediate, notification of motion, sound and button press events.
- Ability to view library recordings, take snapshots and direct stream from cameras.
- Tracking of environmental stats from certain base station types.
- Special switches to trip alarms and take snapshots from cameras.
- Enhanced state notifications.
- Media player support for select devices.

<a name="introduction-notes"></a>
#### Notes
This document assumes you are familiar with Home Assistant setup and configuration.

Wherever you see `/config` in this documenent it refers to your Home Assistant configuration directory. For example, for my installation it's `/home/steve/ha` which is mapped to `/config` by my docker container.

<a name="introduction-thanks"></a>
#### Thanks
Many thanks to:
* [Pyarlo](https://github.com/tchellomello/python-arlo) and [Arlo](https://github.com/jeffreydwalter/arlo) for doing all the hard work figuring the API out and the free Python lesson!
* [sseclient](https://github.com/btubbs/sseclient) for reading from the event stream
* [Button Card](https://github.com/kuuji/button-card/blob/master/button-card.js) for a working lovelace card I could understand
* [![JetBrains](/images/jetbrains.svg)](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=hass-aarlo) for the excellent **PyCharm IDE** and providing me with an open source license to speed up the project development.


<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

<a name="installation-hacs"></a>
#### HACS
[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)
Aarlo is part of the default HACS store. If you're not interested in development branches this is the easiest way to install.

<a name="installation-manually"></a>
#### Manually
Copy the `aarlo` directory into your `/config/custom_components` directory.

<a name="installation-from-script"></a>
#### From Script
Run the install script. Run it once to make sure the operations look sane and run it a second time with the `go` paramater to do the actual work. If you update just rerun the script, it will overwrite all installed files.

```sh
install /config
# check output looks good
install go /config
```

<a name="configuration"></a>
## Configuration

<a name="configuration-moving"></a>
### Moving From Arlo
You can replace all instances of `arlo` with `aarlo` in your Home Assistant configuration files to start using Aarlo. The following sections detail new configuration items you can use to add extra functionality to your new Aarlo component.

You can also run Arlo and Aarlo side by side but you will need to create an Aarlo specific login.

<a name="configuration-login"></a>
### Creating a Login
_If you are replacing the original Arlo component you don't need to do this step._

Aarlo needs a dedicated Aarlo login. If you try to reuse an existing login - for example, the login from the Arlo app on your phone - the app and this component will constantly fight to login.

When you have created the Aarlo login, from your original Arlo account grant access to any devices you want to share and give the Aarlo user admin access.

<a name="configuration-main"></a>
### Main Configuration
The following configuration is the minimim needed.

```yaml
aarlo:
  username: !secret arlo_username
  password: !secret arlo_password
```

The following configuration adds some connection keep alive mechanisms to try to work around limitations in using the Arlo web API.

```yaml
aarlo:
  username: !secret arlo_username
  password: !secret arlo_password
  refresh_devices_every: 2
  stream_timeout: 120
```

* `refresh_devices_every` tells the code to reload the device list every 2 hours.
* `stream_timeout` tells the event stream to restart after 2 minutes of inactivity.

If you still struggle with connectivity you can add the following:

```yaml
  reconnect_every: 90
```

* `reconnect_every` force the system to logout and log back in, in this case every 90 minutes.

<a name="configuration-alarm"></a>
### Alarm Configuration

The following enables and configures the base stations.

```yaml
alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: aarlo
    home_mode_name: home
    away_mode_name: armed
    night_mode_name: night
    trigger_time: 30
    alarm_volume: 8
```

* Arlo does not have a built in `away`, `home` or `night` mode. Use `away_mode_name`, `home_mode_name` and `night_mode_name` to map them to one of your custom Arlo modes. By default `away_mode_name` maps to `Armed`. If you don't map all your modes in there is a possibility the alarm panel will appear blank. Names are case insensitive.
* `trigger_time` determines how long, in seconds, the triggered alarm will sound
* `alarm_volume` determine how loud, from 1 to 8, the triggered alarm will sound

See [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/arlo/#alarm) for more information on mode names. 

<a name="configuration-camera"></a>
### Camera Configuration

The following enables any cameras.

```yaml
camera:
  - platform: aarlo
```

<a name="configuration-binary"></a>
### Binary Sensor Configuration

The following enables and configures the binary sensors.

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: aarlo
    monitored_conditions:
    - motion
    - sound
    - ding
```

Items on the `monitored_conditions` can be one or more of the following:

* `motion` fires when a camera, doorbell or light detects motion.
* `sound` fires when a camera detects a sound.
* `ding` fires when a doorbell is pressed.

The Arlo backend sends the notifications on the event stream so they are (almost) real time.

<a name="configuration-sensor"></a>
### Sensor Configuration

The following enables and configures the sensors.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: aarlo
    monitored_conditions:
    - total_cameras
    - last_capture
    - recent_activity
    - captured_today
    - battery_level
    - signal_strength
    - temperature
    - humidity
    - air_quality
```

Items on the `monitored_conditions` can be one or more of the following:

* `total_cameras` is a global sensor showing the number of cameras detected.

The rest of the sensors appear per camera.

* `last_capture` The last time an event was captured by this camera.
* `recent_activity` Is `on` if activity was recently seen on the camera.
* `captured_today` The number of events captured by the camera today.
* `battery_level` The percentage of battery remaining.
* `signal_strength` The WiFi signal strength of the camera.
* `temperature` The temperature in the room where the camera is, if supported.
* `humidity` The humidity in the room where the camera is, if supported.
* `air_quality` The air quality in the room where the camera is, if supported.

<a name="configuration-light"></a>
### Light Configuration

The following enables any lights:

```yaml
light:
  - platform: aarlo
```

<a name="configuration-switch"></a>
### Switch Configuration

The following enables and configures some pseudo switches:

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: aarlo
    siren: True
    all_sirens: True
    snapshot: True
    siren_volume: 1
    siren_duration: 10
```

* `siren` If `True`, will create a switch for each siren device that allows your to turn it on or off.
* `all_sirens` If `True`, will create a switch for all the siren devices that allows you to turn them all on and off.
* `snapshot` If `True`, will create a switch for each camera to allow you to take a snapshot.

`siren_volume` and `siren_duration` controls how loud, from 1 to 10, the siren is and how long, in seconds, it sounds.

<a name="configuration-media"></a>
### Media Player Configuration

The following enables media player for supported devices:

```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: aarlo
```

<a name="configuration-lovelace"></a>
### Custom Lovelace Card Configuration

A custom Lovelace card which is based on the `picture-glance` can be found here: https://github.com/twrecked/lovelace-hass-aarlo

The custom Lovelace card allows access to the video recordings library and presents customizable camera information on the camera feed. It was influenced by the Arlo web interface camera view.

*This piece is optional, `aarlo` will work with the standard Lovelace cards.*


<a name="other"></a>
## Other

<a name="other-naming"></a>
### Naming
Entity ID naming follows this pattern `component-type.aarlo_lower_case_name_with_underscores`.

For example, a camera called "Front Door" will have an entity id of `camera.aarlo_front_door`.

<a name="other-best"></a>
### Best Practises and Known Limitations
The component uses the Arlo webapi.
* There is no documentation so the API has been reverse engineered using browser debug tools.
* There is no support for smart features, you only get motion detection notifications, not what caused the notification. (Although, you can pipe a snapshot into deepstack...)
* Streaming times out after 30 minutes.
* The webapi doesn't seem like it was really designed for permanent connections so the system will sometimes appear to lock up. Various work arounds are in the code and can be configured at the `arlo` component level. See next paragraph.

If you do find the component locks up after a while (I've seen reports of hours, days or weeks), you can add the following to the main configuration. Start from the top and work down:
* `refresh_devices_every`, tell Aarlo to request the device list every so often. This will sometimes prevent the back end from aging you out. The value is in hours and a good starting point is 3.
* `stream_timeout`, tell Aarlo to close and reopen the event stream after a certain period of inactivity. Aarlo will send keep alive every minute so a good starting point is 180 seconds.
* `reconnect_every`, tell Aarlo to logout and back in every so often. This establishes a new session at the risk of losing an event notification. The value is minutes and a good starting point is 90.
* `request_timout`, the amount of time to allow for a http request to work. A good starting point is 120 seconds.

Unify your alarm mode names across all your base stations. There is no way to specify different mode names for each device.

Alro will allow shared accounts to give cameras their own name. If you find cameras appearing with unexpected names (or not appearing at all), log into the Arlo web interface with your Home Assistant account and make sure the camera names are correct.

<a name="other-debugging"></a>
### Debugging
If you run into problems there please provide the following in the bug report to help debugging.
* Version of software running.
* Make of cameras and base stations you have.

I might also ask you to turn on component logging and event logging. The follow paragraphs show you how, it's safe to leave these running if you fancy pokeing around and trying to find out what it going wrong.

#### Component logging

You can turn this on by adding the following to your `configuration.yaml` file.
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.aarlo: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.alarm_control_panel: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.binary_sensor: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.camera: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.light: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.media_player: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.sensor: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.switch: debug
    pyaarlo: debug
```

If, for example, you suspect the problem is just with your lights you can remove unneeded debug:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.aarlo: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.light: debug
    pyaarlo: debug
```

Home assistant logs everything to `/config/home-assistant.log`, a typical piece of debug from Aarlo looks like this.

```
2020-01-21 11:44:48 DEBUG (ArloBackgroundWorker) [pyaarlo] fast refresh
2020-01-21 11:44:48 DEBUG (ArloBackgroundWorker) [pyaarlo] day testing with 2020-01-21!
2020-01-21 11:44:50 DEBUG (ArloEventStream) [pyaarlo] async ping response subscriptions/XXXXXX-XXX-XXXXXXX_web
```

If you fancy diving in, and please do, searching for exceptions and `traceback`s is a good place to start.

#### Event logging
You can look at what events Arlo is sending you by turning on event stream dumping. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file and Aarlo will dump events into `/config/.aarlo/packets.dump`:

```yaml
aarlo:
    # current config here
    packet_dump: True
```

This file will built up from a constant trickle of packets from Arlo. The following exerpt shows a login confirmation and a subscription check response.

```
{'status': 'connected'}
{ 'action': 'is',
    'from': 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX',
    'resource': 'subscriptions/XXXXXX-XXX-XXXXXXX_web',
    'to': 'XXXXXX-XXX-XXXXXXX_web',
    'transId': 'web!38a29262-1ce0-4c4d-8f75-fafec2c34332'}
```

Another example, if Arlo detects motion you will see a packet with the following field in it:

```
'properties': {'motionDetected': True},
```

### Adding Devices

*Coming soon...*

<a name="advanced"></a>
## Advanced Use

<a name="advanced-parameters"></a>
### All Parameters
The following additional parameters can be specified against the aarlo platform for more granular control:

| Field  | Type | Default | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `db_motion_time`        | integer  | `30` (s)                | Duration of doorbell motion. (Arlo doorbell only indicates motion is present not that it stops) |
| `db_ding_time`          | integer  | `60` (s)                | Duration of doorbell press. (Arlo doorbell only indicates doorbell was pressed, not that it was released) |
| `recent_time`           | integer  | `600` (s)               | Used to hold the cameras in a recent activity state after a recording or streaming event. (Streaming & recording can be over in a few seconds, without this the camera will revert to idle, possibly looking like nothing has happened.) |
| `last_format`           | strftime | `'%m-%d %H:%M'`         | Display format of last captured time  |
| `http_connections`      | integer  | `5`                     | Adjust the number http connections pools to cache |
| `http_max_size`         | integer  | `10`                    | Adjust the maximum number connects to save in the pool |
| `request_timeout`       | time period  | `60`                | Timeout for requests sent to Arlo server. 0 means no timeout. |
| `stream_timeout`        | time period  | `0`                 | Timeout for inactivity on the Arlo event stream. 0 means no timeout. Used to help with Arlo components becoming unresponsive. |
| `reconnect_every`       | integer  | `0` (minutes)           | If not 0 then force a logout every `reconect_entry` time period. Used to help with Arlo components becoming unresponsive.|
| `refresh_devices_every` | integer  | `0` (hours)             | Used to force a refresh every x hours. 0 = no refreshing. Used to resolve issue with mode changes failing after several days of use |
| `packet_dump`           | boolean  | `False`                 | Causes aarlo to store all the packets it sees in `/config/.aarlo/packets.dump` file. Only really needed for debugging and reverse engineering the API. |
| `conf_dir`              | string   | `'/config/.aarlo'`      | Location to store component state. (The default is fine for hass.io, docker, and virtualenv systems - don't set this value unless asked to.) |
| `host`                  | string   | `https://my.arlo.com`   | Sets the host aarlo will connect to |
| `no_media_upload`       | boolean  | `False`                 | Used as a workaround for Arlo issues where the camera never gets a media upload notification. (Not needed in most cases.) |
| `mode_api`              | string   | `auto`                  | available options: [`v1`, `v2`] You can override this by setting this option to  v1 or v2 to use the old or new version exclusively. The default is  auto, choose based on device |

<a name="advanced-statuses"></a>

<a name="advanced-automations"></a>
### Automation Examples

#### Update camera snapshot 3 seconds after a recording event happens

```yaml
- id: 'automation-0100'
  alias: Camera Snapshot
  trigger:
  - entity_id: camera.aarlo_camera1,camera.aarlo_camera2
    for: 00:00:03
    from: 'idle'
    platform: state
    to: 'recording'
  - entity_id: camera.aarlo_camera1,camera.aarlo_camera2
    for: 00:00:03
    from: 'recently active'
    platform: state
    to: 'recording'
  condition: []
  action:
  - data_template:
      entity_id: "{{ trigger.entity_id }}"
    service: camera.aarlo_request_snapshot
```

#### Begin recording when an entity changes state

```yaml
- id: 'automation-0101'
  alias: Record video when garage opens
  description: ''
  trigger:
  - entity_id: cover.garage_door
    platform: state
    to: open
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      duration: 300
      entity_id: camera.aarlo_garage
    service: camera.aarlo_start_recording
```

<a name="advanced-streaming"></a>
### Streaming

Streaming now works "out of the box" for HassOS and Docker installs. To get streaming working in `virtualenv` you still need to make sure a couple of libraries are installed. For `ubuntu` the following works:
```
source your-env/bin/activate
sudo apt install libavformat-dev
sudo apt install libavdevice-dev
pip install av==6.1.2
```

Set `image_click` to `play` on the aarlo glance card.
